                <p>[Verse 1]</p>
                <p>
                    I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through<br>
                    I just can't say I don't love you (yeah)<br>
                    'Cause I love you, yeah<br>
                    It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold<br>
                    But tonight, I'm gon' let you know<br>
                    Let me tell the truth<br>
                    Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
                </p>

                <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
                <p>
                    You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>
                    You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
                    You're scared to be lonely, especially in the night<br>
                    I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time<br>
                    I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love<br>
                    I try to find a reason to pull us apart<br>
                    It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
                    And I know that you're worth it<br>
                    I can't walk away, (oh)
                </p>

                <p>[Chorus]</p>
                <p>
                    Even though we're going through it<br>
                    And it makes you feel alone<br>
                    Just know that I would die for you<br>
                    Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
                    The distance and the time between us<br>
                    It'll never change my mind<br>
                    'Cause baby, I would die for you<br>
                    Baby, I would die for you, yeah
                </p>

                <p>[Verse 2]</p>
                <p>
                    I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're going through<br>
                    But baby-girl, I'm not blaming you<br>
                    Just don't blame me too, yeah<br>
                    'Cause I can't take this pain forever<br>
                    And you won't find no one that's better<br>
                    'Cause I'm right for you, babe<br>
                    I think I'm right for you, babe
                </p>

                <p>
                    I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
                    Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
                    I'm just sayin', yeah<br>
                    I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
                    Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
                    Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

                <p>
                    A club isn't the best place to find a lover<br>
                    So the bar is where I go (Mm)<br>
                    Me and my friends at the table doin' shots<br>
                    Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)<br>
                    And you come over and start up a conversation with just me<br>
                    And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)<br>
                    Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox<br>
                    And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like
                </p>

                <p>
                    Girl, you know I want your love<br>
                    Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
                    Well, come on now, follow my lead<br>
                    I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
                    Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"<br>
                    Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
                    Well, come on now, follow my lead<br>
                    Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

                <p>
                    I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
                    We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
                    Although my heart is fallin' too<br>
                    I'm in love with your body<br>
                    And last night, you were in my room<br>
                    And now my bed sheets smell like you<br>
                    Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new<br>
                    Well, I'm in love with your body

                    One week in, we let the story begin<br>
                    We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)<br>
                    You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat<br>
                    Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)<br>
                    We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour<br>
                    And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)<br>
                    And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat<br>
                    Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like
